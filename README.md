# Custom Godot builder for Learn GDScript

This repository serves to build a custom version of the Godot engine's templates, editor and headless editor, provided a functional repository and branch.

## Configuration

All configuration is done by editing the `.env` file.

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: The username for docker.io where the builder image is stored.
- `DOCKER_BUILDER_VERSION`: The version of the builder image to use when building godot.
- `DOCKER_PUSH`: true|false; when running build-image.sh, whether to push the new image online or keep it in local storage.
- `OSX_SDK_VERSION`: When running build-image.sh, will try to grab this SDK at the root of this repository.
- `GODOT_REPO`: The repository to grab the Godot source from.
- `GODOT_BRANCH`: The branch to grab the Godot source from.
- `PUBLISH_REPO`: The repository that the release will end up in when running publish-release.sh.

## Functions

### build-image.sh

The build system uses a docker image based on Fedora. While building the image, it installs on itself:

- Dependency libraries for building Godot on Linux
- MinGW64/32 to build Windows template
- Builds OSXCross, to build the MacOS template
- EmScripten, to build the Javascript template

This results in a fairly meaty image, but it's re-usable, and it should work across all versions of godot to date.

### build-godot.sh

Pulls the Builder image from docker as defined in `.env`, mounts the build-output/ folder, loads the .env files, clones godot, and runs the start.sh script to compile.

As of this writing, the script:

1. Compiles the X11 editor
2. Compiles the headless tools
3. Compiles the X11 release template
4. Compiles the Windows release template
5. Compiles the Arm64 and x86_64 MacOS release templates, lipo's them together, and builds a .app bundle
6. Compiles the Javascript release template
7. ZIPs up the templates together, then the editor and headless separately, and puts everything into build-output/ as godot-learn.VERSION.TYPE.zip

### publish-release.sh

Uses the github CLI (gh) to remove any previous version using the same tag, makes a new release, and uploads the files produced by build-godot.sh

Once published, the headless and template URLs can be fed into other build systems, chiefly, `registry.gitlab.com/greenfox/godot-build-automation:latest` (see [this guide](https://gitlab.com/greenfox/godot-build-automation/-/blob/master/advanced_topics.md#using-a-custom-build-of-godot)).
